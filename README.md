This is the source to the iPhone Toss game at the 3rd NYC Resistor Interactive Show

The basic idea is to send the iPhone's accelerometer data to a server via socket.io.
The server passes that back out to any listening displays which then fire a virtual
phone onto the Three.js scene.  Box2d.JS was hacked in for good measure.

This code is *awful*, **just awful**.  Don't look at it, or use it, for anything.  I threw
it together in a haphazard fashion, with one hand tied behind my back, blindfolded,
in the dark, while listening to dubstep.  **BEWARE!**

But I wrote it, so up on GitHub it goes.
